# Basic Timer Logic

## Purpose
Implement the core timer logic: start, pause, reset, and countdown.

## Tasks
- Create timer state and logic (countdown, start, pause, reset)
- Ensure timer is accurate (no drift)
- Handle edge cases (e.g., timer already running, timer at zero)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Timer can be started, paused, and reset
- Timer counts down accurately
- No bugs when rapidly starting/pausing/resetting
