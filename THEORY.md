# EggTimer Project: Theory & Planning

## 1. Vision
Create a beautiful, reliable, and user-friendly egg timer app that helps users cook perfect eggs (or anything else) every time.

## 2. Core Goals
- Simple, intuitive interface
- Accurate countdown and alert
- Customizable timer durations
- Optional sound/visual notifications
- Mobile and desktop friendly (responsive)

## 3. User Stories
- As a user, I want to set a timer for a specific duration so I can cook my eggs perfectly.
- As a user, I want to see the time remaining at a glance.
- As a user, I want a clear alert when the timer finishes.
- As a user, I want to easily reset or start a new timer.
- As a user, I want to optionally choose from preset times (soft, medium, hard boiled).

## 4. Features (MVP)
- Start, pause, reset timer
- Set custom time
- Preset buttons (e.g. 3, 5, 7 minutes)
- Visual countdown (number, progress bar, or animation)
- Sound and/or visual alert at end

## 5. Stretch Goals
- Multiple timers
- Save favorite times
- Themed UI (e.g. egg graphics)
- Voice or keyboard controls
- PWA/offline support

## 6. Design Principles
- Minimal, distraction-free UI
- Large, readable numbers
- Accessible (keyboard, screen reader)
- Works on all devices
